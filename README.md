# Toyota-Project
Data Collection and Post Processing Program built using the following: 

*Python including use of: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and other libraries. 
- I work in Python every day - primarily building data analysis projects with pandas
- I successfully built a basic data acquisition program, in Python, to collect instrumentation data and post-process it
- Used this program as a demo tool for an automotive customer

*Signal Processing: 
I am very familiar with frequency analysis of time history data because of my work selling test instrumentation to scientists and engineers
- Specifically, I have experience with FFTs, applying filters, resampling and plotting data 
- My work has been largely with vibration data acquired with sample rates up to 1MHz 
- I understand hardware circuit concepts having worked with front end data acquisition hardware for collecting time domain vibration, acoustic and electrical (high voltage, high current) data 
- I have used Python for basic signal processing of vibration data into the frequency domain 
- Familiar with plotting in Python using the Matplotlib library of tools 

* Usage: 
Data files collected in vehicle from sensors
